 EXOMIZER 1.0 - 2.0:

 An open-source cross-cruncher by Magnus Lind.
 [<a href="http://covertbitops.cjb.net">http://covertbitops.cjb.net</a>]

  Except for the addresses covered by the file itself ($0801-$XXXX), the
  default decruncher also clobbers the following addresses:

   <a href="zpa7.htm">$A7</a>    : Length of sequence
   <a href="zpae.htm">$AE+$AF</a>: Source address
   <a href="zpfb.htm">$FB-$FE</a>: Bit buffers, Destination address lo ($FE)
   <a href="zpff.htm">$FF</a>    : Destination address hi
   <a href="zp0100.htm">$0100-$01BA</a>: Depacker - main code (for V1.1.1+ see below!)
   <a href="zp0334.htm">$0334-$033B</a>: Depacker - tables
   <a href="zp033c.htm">$033C-$03CF</a>: Depacker - tables

 EXOMIZER 2.0:

  The decruncher uses the same ZP-addresses, buffers and stack space like
  the previous version. As it assembles the decruncher on the fly, it is
  too hard to precisely predict all cases where further memory areas are
  clobbered. It should be at least similar to version 1.1.5, though.

 EXOMIZER 1.1.1 - 1.1.5:

  The decruncher clobbers the stack from $0100 to the stackpointer by copying
  186 bytes of itself (and possibly some more) to the stack at $0100-$01xx.

  If the start address of the decrunched data, [start], is lower than $0835
  then the decruncher will clobber the memory from MIN([start] - 25, $07e7)
  to but not including $081d, too. This space is used as a safety buffer.

  If selected, the address $07e7 will be overwritten in order to make the
  decrunch effect visible. This address is the lower right corner of the
  screen.

 EXOMIZER 1.1:

  If the start address of the decrunched data is lower than $0826 then the
  decruncher will clobber the memory from [(the start address) - $30] to
  $0801. This space is used as a safety buffer.

  In all cases the address $07E7 will be overwritten in order to make the
  decrunch effect visible. This address is the lower right corner of the
  screen.

 EXOMIZER 1.0:

  If the start adress of the decrunched data is lower than $0817 then the
  decruncher will clobber the memory from [(the start adress) - $30] to
  $0801. This space is used as a safety buffer.

  If the start adress of the decrunched data is between $0817 and $084D
  then the decruncher will clobber the memory from $07E7 to $0801. This
  space is used as a safety buffer.
