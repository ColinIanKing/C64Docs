			Microprocessors

Description
The 6500/8500 Series family includes a range of software compatible micro-
processors which provide a selection of addressable memory range, interrupt
input options and on-chip oscillators and drivers. All of the microprocessors
within the group are directly bus compatible with the MC6800 series IC's.

The family includes ten microprocessors with on-board clock oscillators and
seven microprocessors driven by external clocks. The on-chip clock versions
are aimed at high performance, low cost applications where single phase crystal
or RC inputs provide the time base. The external clock versions are geared for
multiprocessor system applications where maximum timing control is mandatory.

Description
Commodore offers a wide assortment of peripheral interface devices compatible
with the 6500/8500 microprocessor family. These devices were specifically
designed to simplify the implementation of Input/Output control in micro-
processor systems. All of these devices are TTL compatible, have a single +5
volt supply, and are based on N-channel depletion load technology. Each device
features from 8 to 24 individually programmable I/O lines. Additional func-
tions on selected devices include handshaking capability, control/interrupt
input lines, interrupt output, serial I/O, timers, RAM, and ROM.

Subject: Re: 1551 floppy drive (and: CBM 600 / 6525 TPI)


It is possible to connect two 1551s because one drive can have
two different device numbers. If (and only if) you give them two
different numbers, you can plug both into the computer (you will
need a large table, of course...). See the 1551's user's guide,
appendix A, page 72. There, they explain how to change the device
number by simply removing a jumper on the main circuit of the drive.
I guess you do not have warranty any more...

The jumper selects the decoding of the 6523 which is in the interface
cartridge (but uses address space of the computer's CPU!).
If the device number is 8, the 6523's base address (at the computer side)
is $FEF0. If the device number is 9, its base address is $FEC0.
Because of this fixed decoding, no more than two 1551s can be plugged
into the computer without major changes.

Michael called the 6523 a triple interface adapter (which is it's
official name, I guess). I would rather call it a cripple interface
adapter. In my opinion, the 6523 is just a 'cripple' 6525 TPI (which
is well known from the CBM 500/600/700 series, where two of them
control the IEEE and user port interface).

The 6525 has three 8 bit ports (i.e. TPI=tri port interface) and 40
pins, while the 6523 has three 'cripple' ports and only 28 pins (which
make it cheaper). I guess the internal architecture of both is the same.
Both the 6523 and the 6525 have three data and three direction registers.
The 6525 has two additional: a control and an 'active interrupt register'.

    7    Active Interrupt reg.                - (?)

This is what I found in my notes from 1987. I do not have any data sheets
of these circuits. If anybody has, I would be interested, because I plan
to re-use my old CBM 610 ...

In the 1551 cartridge, port A of the 6523 is used as the data port
(8 bit parallel, which makes it so fast).
Bit 0 and 1 of port B are used as status bits, and bit 6 and 7 of port
C are used for 'busy' and 'strobe' (this is what I called them in my
notes).

RIOT 6532
---------
Source: TOuCHE manual: the keyboard for the Apple-II clone from
the Computer Hobbyvereniging Eindhoven. (They got DDRA and DDRB reversed.)

The RIOT is used at least in the diskdrives of type 2040, 3040, 4040, 8050,
8250. They contaijn two RIOTs (at $0200 and $0280) and a VIA (at $????).

The RIOT (RAM, I/O and Timer) has 128 bytes of RAM, 2 8-bit bidirectional
I/O ports, and a timer that can count down at 4 different rates.

Reg.	Name	Description
---------------------------
 0	PA	Port A data
 1	DDRA	Port A Data Direction Register
 2	PB	Port B data
 3	DDRB	Port B Data Direction Register
 4	Timer	Timer read register
14,0E	T1	1 clocks per decrement
15,0F	T8	8
16,10	T64	64
17,11	T1024	1024

The Data and DDR registers are as usual. The input is a buffer, the output
is a latch.

The Timer register reads out the timer value; its initial value is set by
writing into the T1..T1024 registers. Which one is used determines the
number of clock cycles between decrements of the Timer register.

The chip also has an IRQ line but the cited source does not say anything
further about it. The 8050 fdc rom usage suggests an irq is generated on
timer underflow, with no special setup required.

		Video Display Devices

Description
Commodore's family of Video Controllers offers attractive integration of all
video logic necessary for color video graphics and text applications, such as
low cost CRT terminals, industrial monitors, control system displays and home
video games. Complete logic to implement all format timing, memory interface,
attribute control, row buffering and high-speed shifting of pixel data are
resident in each device.

The family of VIC II and TED devices provide fixed format display with 5 sepa-
rate character/bit-map modes of operation. A raster Compare Interrupt allows
the easy mixing of these modes for display of high-res graphics with text. A
transparent scheme of using PhO time for fetching video data from memory allows
for optimal CPU thruput. The VICs a|so contain a special type of display image,
Movable Image Block (MIB), that once defined, can be moved to any screen posi-
tion without the inherent character cell constraints.

The programmable 8563/68 features digital RGBI output for very sharp 640Vx400H
color video. Direct video memory interface to 64K of DRAM requires no external
logic.

  The VDC VideoRAM Upgrade


From: Raymond Carlsen &lt;rrcc@u.washington.edu&gt;
Newsgroups: comp.sys.cbm
Subject: Re: W: 8563 RAM swap instructions
Date: Wed, 27 Sep 1995 20:50:02 -0700

&gt; The subject says it all. How do you do this 16k to 64k swap?

     I assume you mean the video RAM upgrade for the C-128. If you're
good with a de-soldering iron, it just involves removing two chips from
the board and installing replacements. The original chips are 4416 DRAM
at board locations U23 and U25 inside the metal can, between the VIC and
RGB chips. The replacements are 4464. The numbers on the chips may vary
with manufacturers, but the originals are 4 bit wide 16K... two of them
make 16K by 8 bits. The upgrade to two 4 bit wide 64K chips give a total
of 64K by 8 for the flat 128. The 128D was built with 64K of VRAM already
installed.
     I always install sockets anytime I replace chips in a PC board.
Removing the old chips is the worst part of the job. Probably the easiest
way is to cut all of the pins on the old chip, then remove them one at a
time with a regular iron. As a tech, I hate to destroy anything that
still works. I use a desoldering iron to free each pin, then remove the
chip intact. If the new chips don't work for any reason, I can cross
check my work by reinstalling the old ones. Sockets mean never having to
solder again. It's important to orient the new chips in the board correctly.
One end of the chip will have a notch and the outline on the board will match.

     Unless you have software that takes advantage of the extra video RAM
you will not see any difference in the performance of your computer. I
think Maverick uses that RAM space to speed up copying files. It's useful
for improved bitmapped graphics. It is only good for the 80 column screen...
the 40 column VIC doesn't access it. To verify C-128 VRAM as either 16K or
64K, run this little program:

POKE DEC(&quot;D600&quot;),28:POKE DEC(&quot;D601&quot;),63:SYS DEC(&quot;FF62&quot;):SCNCLR  &lt;RETURN&gt;

If the screen shows the READY prompt and looks normal, the 128 has 64K
of VRAM installed. If it only has 16K (stock 128 without upgrade), the
screen fills up with zeros. Hit RUN/STOP-RESTORE to clear it.

     At one time, some company was selling a piggyback board with the RAM
installed. It needed no soldering as the on-board 4116s were bypassed. All
that was necessary was to remove the 80 Column RGB (8563, also known as
the VDC) chip from its' socket, install the piggyback board and plug the
RGB chip into the piggyback. I haven't seen that board advertised for
some time.

     [Chips are available from Jameco Electronics @ 1-800-831-4242. Order
part #41582 (41464-12), or 41574 (41464-10), or 41611 (41464-80). They
cost less than 3 bucks each. Jameco also has other replacement chips for
Commodore computers.]

	82 S 100  Field Programmable Logic Array (16 x 48 x 8)

Description

The 82S100 (Three-State) and 82 S 101 (Open Collector) are Bipolar, Fuse-Link
Programmable Logic Arrays (FPLAs). Each device utilizes the standard
AND/OR/Invert architecture to directly implement custom sum-of-product logic
equations.

Each device consists of 16 dedicated inputs and 8 dedicated outputs. Each
output is capable of being actively controlled by any or all of the 48
product terms. The true, complement, or don't care condition of each of the
16 inputs ANDed together comprise one P-Term. All 48 P-Terms are then OR-d
to each output. The user must then only select which P-Terms will activate
an output by disconnecting terms which do not affect the output. In addition,
each output can be fused as active high (H) or active low (L).

The 82S100 and 82S101 are  fully TTL compatible and includes chip-enable
control for expansion of input variables and output inhibit. They feature
either Three-State or Open Collector outputs for ease of expansion of product
terms and application in bus-organized systems.


Features:
	Field programmable Ni-Cr links
	16 inputs
	8 outputs
	48 product terms
	Address access time:
	   S82S100/101:	80 ns max
	   N82S100/101:	50 ns max (Commercial verion)
	Power dissipation - 600mW typ
	Input loading - 100uA max
	Chip enable input
	Three state outputs
	Separate I/O architecture

Applications
	CRT display systems
	Random logic
	Code conversion
	Peripheral controllers
	Function generators
	Look-up and decision tables
	Microprogramming
	Address mapping
	Character generators
	Data security encoders
	Fault detectors
	Frequency synthesizers
	16-bit to 8-bit bus interface


The 82S100 devices are shipped in an unprogrammed state characterised by:
All internal Ni-Cr links are intact and therefore each product term contains
both true and complement values of every input variable,
the OR matrix contains all 48 P-Terms,
the polarity of each output is set to active high,
all outputs are at a low logic level.
