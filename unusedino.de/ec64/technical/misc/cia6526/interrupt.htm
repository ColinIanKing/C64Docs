<title>6526 CIA: INTERRUPT CONTROL</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<h1 align="center">Interrupt Control Register (ICR)</h1>

<p align="justify">There are five sources of interrupts on the 6526: underflow from
TIMER A, underflow from TIMER B, TOD ALARM, Serial Port full/empty
and <img src="flag.gif">. A single register provides masking and
interrupt information. The interrupt Control Register consists of a
write-only MASK register and a read-only DATA register. Any
interrupt will set the corresponding bit in the DATA register. Any
interrupt which is enabled by the MASK register will set the IR bit
(MSB) of the DATA register and bring the <img src="irq.gif"> pin
low. In a multi-chip system, the IR bit can be polled to detect
which chip has generated an interrupt request. The interrupt DATA
register is cleared and the <img src="irq.gif"> line returns high
following a read of the DATA register. Since each interrupt sets an
interrupt bit regardless of the MASK, and each interrupt bit can be
selectively masked to prevent the generation of a processor
interrupt, it is possible to intermix polled interrupts with true
interrupts. However, polling the IR bit will cause the DATA
register to clear, therefore, it is up to the user to preserve the
information contained in the DATA register if any polled interrupts
were present.</p>

<p align="justify">The MASK register provides convenient control of individual mask
bits. When writing to the MASK register, if bit 7 (SET/CLEAR) of
the data written is a ZERO, any mask bit written with a one will be
cleared, while those mask bits written with a zero will be
unaffected. If bit 7 of the data written is a ONE, any mask bit
written with a one will be set, while those mask bits written with
a zero will be unaffected. In order for an interrupt flag to set IR
and generate an Interrupt Request, the corresponding MASK bit must
be set.</p>
