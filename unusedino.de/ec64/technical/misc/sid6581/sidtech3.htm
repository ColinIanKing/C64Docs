	<h3>SID PIN DESCRIPTION</h3>

	<dl>
		<dt>&#160;<br><i>CAP1A, CAP1B (Pins 1, 2)/ CAP2A, CAP2B (pins 3,4)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">These pins are used to connect the two integrating capacitors requires by
		the programmable filter. C1 connects between pins 1 and 2, C2 between pins
		3 and 4. Both capacitors should be the same value. Normal operation of the
		Filter over the audio range (approximately 30Hz- 12kHz) is accomplished
		with a value of 2200 pF for C1 and C2. Polystyrene capacitors are preferred
		and in complex polyphonic systems, where many SID chips must track each
		other, matched capacitors are recommened.</p>
		<p align="justify">The frequency range of the filter can be tailored to specific applications
		by the chooice of capacitor values. For example, a low-cost game may not
		require full high-frequency response. In thise case, larger values for C1
		and C2 could be chosen to provide more control over the bass frequencies
		of the filter. The maximum cutoff frequency of the filter is given by:<br>
		<br>
		FCmax = 2.6E-5 / C<br>
		<br>
		Where C is the capacitor value. The range of the Filter extends 9 octaves
		below the maximum cutoff frequency.
		<i>[Transcriber's note: Allegedly, one of the designers should later have stated
		that the above formula is wrong].</i></p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>RES (Pin 5)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">This TTL-level input is the reset control for SID. When brought low for
		at least ten &oslash;2 cycles, all internal registers are reset to zero
		and the audio output is silenced. This pin is normally connected to the
		reset line of the microprocessor or a power-on-clear circuit.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>&oslash;2 (Pin 6)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">This TTL-level input is the master clock for SID. All oscillator frequencies
		and envelope rates are referenced to this clock. &oslash;2 also controls
		data transfers between SID and the microprocessor. Data can only be transferred
		when &oslash;2 is high. Essentially, &oslash;2 acts as a high-active chip
		select as far as data transfers are concerned. This pin is normally connected
		to the system clock, with a nominal operating frequency of 1.0 MHz.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>R/W (Pin 7)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">This TTL-level input controls the direction of data transfers between SID
		and the microprocessor. If the chip select conditions have been met, a high
		on this line allows the microprocessor to read data from the selected SID
		register and a low allows the microprocessor to write data into the selected
		SID register. This pin is normally connected to the system Read/Write line.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>CS (Pin 8)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">This TTL-level input is a low active chip select which controls data transfers
		between SID and the microprocessor. CS must be low for any transfer. A read
		from the selected SID register can only occur if CS is low, &oslash;2 is
		high and R/W is high.
		A write to the selected SID register can only occur if CS is low, &oslash;2
		is high and R/W is low. This pin is normally connected to address decoding
		circuitry, allowing SID to reside in the memory map of a system.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>A0-A4 (Pins 9-13)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">These TTL-level inputs are used to select one of the 29 SID registers. Although
		enough addresses are provided to select 1 of 32 registers, the remaining
		three register locations are not used. A write to any of theses three locations
		is ignored and a read returns invalid data. These pins are normally connected
		to the corresponding address lines of the microprocessor so that SID may
		be addressed in the same manner as memory.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>GND (Pin 14)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">For best results, the ground line between SID and the power supply should
		be separate from ground lines to other digital circuitry. This will minimize
		digital noise at the audio output.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>D0-D7 (Pins 15-22)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">These bidirectional lines are used to transfer data between SID and the
		microprocessor. They are TTL compatible in the input mode and capable of
		driving 2 TTL loads in the output mode. The data buffers are usually in
		the high-impedance off state. During a write operation, the data buffers
		remain in the off (input) state and the microprocessor supplies data to
		SID over theses lines. During a read operation, the data buffers turn on
		and SID supplies data to the microprocessor over these lines. The pins are
		normally connected to the corresponding data lines of the microprocessor.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>POTX, POTY (Pins 24, 23)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">These pins are inputs to the A/D converters used to digitize the position
		of potentiometers. The conversion process is based on the time constant
		of a capacitor tied from the POT pin to ground, charged by a potentiometer
		tied from the POT pin to +5 volts. The component values are determined by:<br>
		<br>
		R*C = 4.7E-4<br>
		<br>
		Where R is the maximum resistance of the pot and C is the capacitor. The
		larger the capacitor, the smaller the POT value jitter. The recommended
		values for R and C are 470 kOhm and 1000 pF. Note that a separate pot and
		cap are required for each POT pin.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>Vcc (Pin 25)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">As with the GND line, a separate +5 VDC line should be run between SID Vcc
		and the power supply in order to minimize noise. A bypass capacitor should
		be located close to the pin.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>EXT IN (Pin 26)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">This analog input allows external audio signals to be mixed with the audio
		output of SID or processed through the filter. Typical sources include voice,
		guitar, and organ. The input impedance of this pin is on the order of 100
		kOhm. Any signal applied directly to the pin should ride at a DC level of
		6 volts and should not exceed 3 volts p-p.</p>
		<p align="justify">In order to prevent any interference caused by DC level differences, external
		signals should be AC-coupled to EXT IN by an electrolytic capacitor in the
		1-10 uF range. As the direct audio path (FILTEX = 0) has unity gain, EXT
		IN can be used to mix outputs of many SID chips by daisy-chaining. The number
		of chips that can be chained in this manner is determined by the amount
		of noise and distortion allowable at the final output. Note that the output
		volume control will affect not only the three SID voices, but also any external
		inputs.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>AUDIO OUT (Pin 27)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">This open-source buffer is the final audio output of SID, comprised of the
		three SID voices, the filter and any external input. The output level is
		set by the output volume control and reaches a maximum of 2 volts p-p at
		a DC level of 6 volts. A source resistor from AUDIO OUT to ground is required
		for proper operation. The recommended resistance is 1 kOhm for a standard
		output impedance.
		As the output of SID rides at a 6-volt DC level, it should be AC-coupled
		to any amplifier with an elctrolytic capacitor in the 1-10 uF range.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>Vdd (Pin 28)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">As with Vcc, a separate +12 VDC line should be run to SID Vdd and a bypass
		capacitor should be used.</p></dd>
