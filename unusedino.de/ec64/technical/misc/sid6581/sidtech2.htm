	<h3>VOICE 1</h3>

	<dl>
		<dt>&#160;<br><i>FREQ LO/FREQ HI (Registers 00,01)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">Together these registers form a 16-bit number which linearly controls the
		frequncy of Osscillator 1. The frequency is determined by the following equation:<br>
		<br>
		Fout = (Fn * Fclk / 16777216) Hz<br>
		<br>
		Where Fn is the 16-bit number in the frequency registers and Fclk is the
		system clock applied to the Phi2 input (pin 6). For a standard 1.0 MHz clock,
		the frequency is given by:<br>
		<br>
		Fout = (Fn * 0.059604645) Hz<br>
		<br>
		It should be noted that the frequency resolution of SID is sufficient for
		any tuning scale and allows sweeping from note to note (portamento) with
		no dicernable frequency steps.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>PW LO/PW HI (Registers 02,03)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">Together these registers form a 12-bit number (bits 4-7 of PW HI are not
		used) which linearly controls the pulse width (duty cycle) of the pulse
		waveform on Oscillator 1. The pulse width is determined by the following
		equation:<br>
		<br>
		PWout = (PWn/40.95) %<br>
		<br>
		Where PWn is the 12-bit number in the Pulse Width registers.
		The pulse width resolution allows the width to be smoothly swept with no
		discernable stepping. Note that the pulse waveform on Oscillator 1 must
		be selected in order for the pulse width registers to have any audible effect.
		A value of 0 or 4095 ($FFF) in the pulse width registers will poroduce a
		constant DC output, while a value of 2048 ($800) will produce a square wave.
		[A value of 4095 will not produce a constant DC output].</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>CONTROL REGISTER (Register 04)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">This register contains eight control bits which select various options on
		Oscillator 1. 
		<ul>
			<li><p align="justify">GATE (Bit 0): The GATE bit controls the envelope generator for voice
			1. When this bit is set to one, the envelope generator is gated (triggered)
			and the ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN cycle is initiated. When the bit is reset to
			zero, the RELEASE cycle begins. The envelope generator controls the amplitude
			of Oscillator 1 appearing at the audio output, therefore, the GATE bit must
			be set (along with suitable envelope parameters) for the selceted output
			of oscillator 1 to be audible.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">SYNC (Bit 1): The SYNC bit, when set to one, synchronizes the fundamental
			frequency of oscillator 1 with the fundamental frequency of oscillator 3,
			producing &quot;Hard Sync&quot; effects. Varying the frequency of oscillator
			1 with respect to oscillator 3 produces a wide range of complex harmonic
			structures from voice 1 at the frequency of oscillator 3. In order for sync
			to occur, oscillator 3 must be set to some frequency other than zero but
			preferable lower than the frequency of oscillator 1. No other parameters
			of voice 3 have any effect on sync.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">RING MOD (Bit 2): The RING MOD bit, when set to a one, replaces the
			triangle waveform of output of oscillator 1 with a &quot;Ring Modulated&quot;
			combination of oscillators 1 and 3. Varying the frequency of oscillator
			1 with respect to oscillator 3 produces a wide range ofnon-harmonic overtone
			structures for creating bell or gong sounds and for special effects. In
			order for ring modulation to be audible, the triangle waveform of oscillator
			1 must be selected and oscillator 3 must be set to some frequency other
			than zero. No other parameters of voice 3 have any effect on ring modulation.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">TEST (Bit 3): The TEST bit, when set to one, resets and locks oscillator
			1 at zero until the TEST bit is cleared. The noise waveform output of oscillator
			1 is also reset and the pulse waveform output is held at a DC level. Normally
			this bit is used for testing purposes, however, it can be used to synchronize
			oscillator 1 to external events, allowing the generation of highly complex
			waveforms under real-time software control.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify"><tt>/\/\</tt> (Bit 4): When set to a one, the triangle waveform output
			of oscillator 1 is selected. The triangle waveform is low in harmonics and
			has a mellow, flute-like quality.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify"><tt>///</tt> (Bit 5): When set to one, the sawtooth waveform output
			of oscillator 1 is selected. The sawtooth waveform is rich in even and odd
			harmonics and has a bright, brassy quality.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">PULSE (Bit 6): When set to one, the pulse waveform output of oscillator
			1 is selected. The harmonic content of this waveform can be adjusted by
			the pulse width registers, producing tone qualities ranging from a bright,
			hollow square wave to a reedy pulse. Sweeping the pulse width in real-time
			produces a dynamic &quot;phasing&quot; effect which adds a sense of motion
			to the sound. Rapidly jumping between different pulse widths can produce
			interesting harmonic sequences.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">NOISE (bit 7): When set to one, the noise output waveform of oscillator
			1 is selected. This output is a random signal which changes at the frequency
			of oscillator 1. The sound quality can be varied from a low rumbling to
			hissing white noise via the oscillator frequency registers. Noise is useful
			in creating explosions, gunshots, jet engines, wind, surf and other unpitched
			sounds, as well as snare drums and cymbals. Sweeping the oscillator frequency
			with noise selected produces a dramatic rushing effect. [The Noise output
			is not &quot;true&quot; random, as it is based on a 23 bit internal register].</p></li>
		</ul>
		One of the output waveforms must be selected for oscillator 1 to be audible,
		however it is NOT nescessary to de-select waveforms to silence the output
		of voice 1. The amplitude of voice 1 at the final output is a function of
		the envelope generator only.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>NOTE:</b> The oscillator output waveforms
		are NOT additive. If more than one output waveform is selected simultaneously,
		the result will be a logical ANDing of the waveforms.
		<i>[Transcriber's note: This is most probably wrong. Some claim that it is
		the &quot;min&quot; function that is used, but my experience is that it
		is more complex than that].</i></p>
		<p align="justify">Although this technique can be used to generate additional waveforms beyond
		the four listed above, it must be used with care. If any other waveform
		is selected while noise is on, the noise output can &quot;lock up&quot;.
		If this occurs, the noise output will remain silent until reset by the TEST
		bit or by bringing RES (pin 5) low.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>ATTACK/DECAY (Register 05)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">Bits 4-7 of this registers (ATK0-ATK3) select 1 of 16 ATTACK rates for the
		voice 1 envelope generator. The ATTACK rate determines how rapidly the output
		of voice 1 rises from zero to peak amplitude when the envelope generator
		is gated. The 16 ATTACK rates are listed in Table 2.</p>
		<p align="justify">Bits 0-3 (DCY0-DCY3) select 1 of 16 DECAY rates for the envelope generator.
		The DECAY cycle follows the ATTACK cycle and the DECAY rate determines how
		rapidly the output falls from the peak amplitude to the selected SUSTAIN
		level. The 26 DECAY rates are listed in Table 2.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>SUSTAIN/RELEASE (Register 06)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">Bits 4-7 of this register (STN0-STN3) select 1 of 16 SUSTAIN levels for
		the envelope generator. The SUSTAIN cycle follows the DECAY cycle and the
		output of voice 1 will remain at the selected SUSTAIN amplitude as long
		as the gate bit remains set. The SUSTAIN levels range form zero to peak
		amplitude in 16 linear steps, with a SUSTAIN value of 0 selecting zero amplitude
		and a SUSTAIN value of 15 ($F) selecting the peak amplitude. A SUSTAIN value
		of 8 would cause voice 1 to SUSTAIN at an amplitude one-half the peak amplitude
		reached by the ATTACK cycle.</p>
		<p align="justify">Bits 0-3 (RLS0-RLS3) select 1 of 16 RELEASE rates for the envelope generator.
		The RELEASE cycle follows the SUSTAIN cycle when the gate bit is reset to
		zero. At this time, the output of voice 1 will fall from the SUSTAIN amplitude
		to zero amplitude at the selected RELEASE rate. The 16 RELEASE rates are
		identical to the DECAY rates.</p>
		<p align="justify"><b>NOTE:</b> The cycling of the envelope generator can be altered at any
		point via the gate bit. The envelope generator can be gated and released
		without restriction. For example, if the gate bit is reset before the envelope
		has finished the ATTACK cycle, the RELEASE cycles will immediately begin,
		starting from whatever amplitude had been reached. If the envelope is then
		gated again (before the RELEASE cycle has reached zero amplitude), another
		ATTACK cycle will begin, starting from whatever amplitude had been reached.
		This technique can be used to generate complex amplitude envelopes via real-time
		software control.</p>

	<h3>VOICE 2</h3>

	<p align="justify">Registers $07-$0D control voice 2 and are functionally identical to registers
	$00-$06 with these exceptions: 
	<ol>
	<li>When selected, SYNC synchronizes oscillator 2 with oscillator 1.</li>
	<li>When selected, RING MOD replaces the triangle output of oscillator 2
	with the ring modulated combinations of oscillators 2 and 1.</li>
	</ol></p>

	<h3>VOICE 3</h3>

	<p align="justify">Registers $0E-$14 control voice 3 and are functionally identical to registers
	$00-$06 with these exceptions: 
	<ol>
	<li>When selected, SYNC synchronizes oscillator 3 with oscillator 2.</li>
	<li>When selected, RING MOD replaces the triangle output of oscillator 3
	with the ring modulated combinations of oscillators 3 and 2.</li>
	</ol></p>

	<p align="justify">Typical operation of a voice consists of selecting the desired parameters:
	frequency, effects (SYNC, RING MOD) and envelope rates, then gating the
	voice whenever the sound is desired. The sound can be sustained for any
	length of time and terminated by clearing the gate bit. Each voice can be
	used separately, with independent parameters and gating, or in unison to
	create a single, powerful voice. When used in unison, a slight detuning
	of each oscillator or tuning to musical intervals creates a rich, animated
	sound.</p>

	<h3>FILTER</h3>

	<dl>
		<dt>&#160;<br><i>FC LO/FC HI (Reigster $15, $16)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">Together these registers form an 11-bit number (bits 3-7 of FC LO are not
		used) which linearly controls the cutoff (or center) frequency of the programmable
		filter. The approximate cutoff frequency ranges from 30 Hz to 12 KHz.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>RES/FILT (Register $17)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">Bits 4-7 of this register (RES0-RES3) control the resonance of the filter.
		Resonance is a peaking effect which emphasizes frequency components at the
		cutoff frequency of the filter, causing a sharper sound. There are 16 resonance
		settings ranging linearly from no resonance (0) to maximum resonance (15
		or $F).</p>
		<p align="justify">Bits 0-3 determine which signals will be routed through the Filter:<ul>
			<li><p align="justify">FILT 1 (Bit 0): When set to a zero, Voice 1 appears directly at the audio
			output and the Filter has no effect on it. When set to a one, Voice 1 will
			be processed through the Filter and the harmonic content of Voice 1 will
			be altered according to the selected Filter parameters.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">FILT 2 (Bit 1): Same as bit 0 for Voice 2.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">FILT 3 (Bit 2): Same as bit 0 for Voice 3.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">FILTEX (Bit 3): Same as bit 0 for External audio input (pin 26).</p></li>
		</ul></p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>MODE/VOL (Register $18)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">Bits 4-7 of this register select various filter mode and output options:<ul>
			<li><p align="justify">LP (Bit 4): When set to a one, the low-pass output of the filter is selected
			and sent to the audio output. For a given filter input signal, all frequency
			components below the filter cutoff frequency are passed unaltered, while
			all frequency components above the cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 12
			dB/Octave. The low-pass mode produces full-bodied sounds.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">BP (Bit 5): Same as bit 4 for the bandpass output. All frequency components
			above and below the cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 6 dB/Octave. The
			bandpass mode produces thin, open sounds.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">HP (Bit 6): Same as bit 4 for the high-pass output. All frequency components
			above the Cutoff are passed unaltered, while all freqeuncy components below
			the cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 12 dB/Octave. The high-pass mode
			produces thin, buzzy sounds.</p></li>
			<li><p align="justify">3 OFF (Bit 7): When set to a one, the output of voice 3 is disconnected
			from the direct audio path. Setting voice 3 to bypass the filter (FILT 3
			= 0) and setting 3 OFF to a one prevents voice 3 from reaching the audio
			output. This allows voice 3 to be used for modulation purposes without any
			undesirable output.</p></li>
		</ul></p>
		<p align="justify"><b>NOTE:</b> The filter output modes ARE additive and multiple filter modes
		may be selected simultaneously. For example, both LP and HP modes can be
		selected to produce a notch (or band reject) filter response. In order for
		the filter to have any audible effect, at least one filter output must be
		selected and at least one voice must be routed through the filter.
		The filter is, perhaps, the most important element in SID as it allows the
		generation of complex tone colors via subtractive synthesis (the filter
		is used to eliminate specific frequency componenets from a harmonically
		rich input signal). The best results are achieved by varying the cutoff
		frequency in real-time.</p>
		<p align="justify">Bits 0-3 (VOL0-VOL3) select 1 of 16 overall volume levels for the final
		composite audio output. The output volume levels range from no output (0)
		to maximum volume (15 or $F) in 16 linear steps. This control can be used
		as a static volume control for balancing levels in multi-chip systems or
		for creating dynamic volume effects, such as tremolo. Some volume level
		other than zero must be selected in order for SID to produce any sound.</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>POTX (Register $19)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">This register allows the microprocessor to read the position of the potentiometer
		tied to POTX (pin 24), with values ranging from 0 at minimum resistance,
		to 255 ($FF) at maximum resistance. See the Pin Description section for
		information on pot and capacitor values.[This register is supposed to be
		updated every 512 cycles].</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>POTY (Register $1A)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">Same as POTX for the pot tied to POTY (pin 23).</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>OSC 3/RANDOM (Register $1B)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">This register allows the microprocessor to read the upper 8 output bits
		of oscillator 3. The character of the numbers generated is directly related
		to the waveform selected. If the sawtooth waveform of oscillator 3 is selected,
		this register will present a series of numbers incrementing from 0 to 255
		($FF) at a rate detmined by the frequency of oscillator 3. If the triangle
		waveform is selected, the output will increment from 0 up to 255, then decrement
		down to 0.
		<i>[Transcriber's note: This is 0,1,..,254,255,255,254,..1,0,0,1..]</i></p>
		<p align="justify">If the pulse waveform is selected, the output will jump between 0 and 255.
		Selecting the noise waveform will produce a series of random numbers, therefore,
		this register can be used as a random number generator for games. There
		are numerous timing and sequencing applications for the OSC 3 register,
		however, the chief function is probably that of a modulation generator.
		The numbers generated by this register can be added, via software, to the
		oscillator or filter frequency registers or the pulse width registers in
		real-time. Many dynamic effects can be generated in this manner. Siren-like
		sounds can be created by adding the OSC 3 Sawtooth output to the frequency
		control of another oscillator. Synthesizer &quot;Sample and Hold&quot; effects
		can be created by adding the OSC 3 Sawtooth output to the Filter Frequency
		control registers. Vibrato can be produced by setting Oscillator 3 to a
		frequency around 7 Hz and adding the OSC 3 triangle output (with proper
		scaling) to the Frequency control of another oscillator. An unlimited range
		of effects are available by altering the frequency of oscillator 3 and scaling
		the OSC 3 output. Normally, when oscillator 3 is used for modulation, the
		audio output of voice 3 should be eliminated (3 Off = 1).</p></dd>

		<dt>&#160;<br><i>ENV 3 (Register $1C)</i></dt>
		<dd>&#160;<br><p align="justify">Same as OSC 3, but this register allows the microprocessor to read the output

		frequency to produce harmonic envelopes, WAH-WAH, and similar effects. &quot;Phaser&quot;
		sounds can be created by adding this output to the frequency control registers
		of an oscillator. The voice 3 envelope generators must be gated in order
		to produce any output from this register. The OSC 3 register, however, always
		reflects the changing output of the oscillator and is not affected in any
		way by the envelope generator.</p></dd>
