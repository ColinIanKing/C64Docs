	<h3>CONCEPT</h3>

	<p align="justify">The 6581 Sound Interface Device (SID) is a single-chip, 3-voice electronic
	music synthesizer/sound effects generator compatible with the 65XX and similar
	microprocessor families. SID provides wide-range, high-resolution control
	of pitch (frequency), tone color (harmonic content), and dynamics (volume).
	Specialized control circuitry minimizes software overhead, facilitating
	use in arcade/home video games and low-cost musical instruments.</p>

	<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

	<p align="justify">The 6581 consists of three synthesizer &quot;voices&quot; which can be used
	independently or in conjunction with each other (or external audiosources)
	to create complex sounds.
	Each voice consists of a tone oscillator/waveform generator,an envelope
	generator and an amplitudemodulator.
	The tone oscillator produces four waveforms at the selected frequency, with
	the unique harmonic content of each waveform providing simple control of
	tone color. The volume dynamics of the oscillator are controlled by the
	amplitude modulator under the direction of the envelope generator. When
	triggered, the envelope generator creates an amplitude envelope with programmable
	rates of increasing and decreasing volume.
	In addition to the three voices, a programmable filter is provided for generating
	complex, dynamic tone colors via subtractive synthesis.
	Please note that the SID is not a FM-based synthesizer, like the Yamaha
	OPL series !!</p>

	<p align="justify">SID allows the microprocessor to read the changing output of the third oscillator
	and third envelope generator. These outpus can be used as a source of modulation
	information for creating vibrato, frequency/filter sweeps and similar effects.
	Two A/D converters are provided for interfacing SID with potentiometers.
	These can be used for &quot;paddles&quot; in a game environment or as front
	panel controls in a music synthesizer. SID can process external audio signals,
	allowing multiple SID chips to be daisy-chained or mixed in complex polyphonic
	systems.</p>
