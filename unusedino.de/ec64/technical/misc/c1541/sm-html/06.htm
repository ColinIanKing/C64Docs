<h3>The Reset Circuit</h3>

The output of the exclusive 'or' gate UD3 pin 6 will be "low" until C46 has charged through R25. Once the voltage across C46 reaches 2 volts, the output of UD3 pin 6 will go "high". This occurs when the disk is powered on, or a reset pulse is generated by
a device connected to the serial bus. The reset pulse on the serial bus interface is input on, pin 6 of P2 or P3. This "low" to "high" going pulse on pin 6 of UD3 is input to the microprocessors reset interrupt input. This causes a restart on reset
routine to be executed giving control of the disk drive operation to the Disk Operating System (DOS).
