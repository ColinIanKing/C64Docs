<h3>Microprocessor Control of RAM and ROM</h3>

UB3 and UB4 are 8192 x 8 bit ROMS that store the Disk Operating System (DOS). UB3 resides at memory locations $C000-$DFFF. UB4 resides at memory locations $E000-$FFFF. UC5 and UC6 decodes the addresses output from the microprocessor when selecting these
ROMS. 

<p>UB2 is a 2048 x 8 bit RAM. UB2 resides at memory locations $0000-$07FF. This memory is used for processor stack operations, general processor housekeeping, use program storage, and 4 temporary buffer areas. UC5, UC6 and UC7 decode the addresses output
from the processor when selecting RAM.</p>
